In this project we covered 3 methods of installation of Linux Kernel: installing kernel archives and make oldconfig, make
menuconfig, and kernel mainline. We found out our version and according to that installed needed version of archive, then we used make oldconfig. In second one, we used command make menuconfig to do custom installation step by step. And the last one we used the kernel mainline. That's the methhods we can use to install Linux Kernel.
Now, in this repository you can find our 3 models that were needed to be done. The first model is the Hello World module. Here created a folder "mkdir custom_modules" where we created 2 files: "Makefile" and helloworldmodule.o - our Hello World module. We save that 2 files and run them  by command "make" This will create the helloworld.ko kernel module file. Then we load module and on the screenshots you can see the signature "Hello World"
By the same method, we do the same thing for module of "Current Timer"  and "imitation device callback". In this repository we named each folders with their files. You can read all of the codes here and check them out. 

In this course "Operating system Concepts" we worked on a virtual machine, did calculations and used OC Linux.  This brought us a lot of useful information, which we later adopted in practice, as well as in the final exam.  

In the final exam, we created new users, connected to the Internet in various ways, and most importantly, created linux kernel modules.  Each student contributed equally to the development of the final exam and also learned many useful skills.
